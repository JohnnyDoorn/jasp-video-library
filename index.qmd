Awesome! We are always looking to expand our library with more instructional video's! If you are familiar with GitHub, you can visit [our repository](https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-video-library) for more detailed instructions. If not, you can send your instructional video's over by [e-mailing Johnny](mailto:j.b.vandoorn@uva.nl). Please make sure to use the `.mp4` file format, and to record your video on a high-resolution screen.
