# The JASP Video Library

Here you will find screenrecordings that illustrate all sorts of lovely analyses in JASP. Do you want to contribute? Awesome!
Recording instructions:
1. Make your screenrecording on a high-resolution screen
2. Use the .mp4 format for your video's

Adding your videos to the library:
1. Fork this repository
2. Add your video's to the corresponding folder (or make a new folder if that module is not in the library yet)
3. Use the existing file/folder structure - this enables us to automatically update the video library in a clean way!
    - Modules get their own folder
    - Inside these folders, sub-folders can be used for specific analyses (e.g., `ANOVA_Oneway`)
    - Videofile names start with the analysis name (use `_` as separator here), followed by a number for the order, followed by the video title (use `-` as separator here)
    - For instance, `ANOVA_Oneway_1_Main-Analysis.mp4` is nested in `ANOVA_Oneway` folder, which is contained in the `ANOVA` folder.
4. Make a Pull Request to this repository and tag @JohnnyDoorn
5. Bask in our eternal gratitude =)
